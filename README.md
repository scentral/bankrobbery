# Bank Robbery
This is a **standalone** resource meaning it is only intended for RP purposes and currently does not support any frameworks.

## Installation
- Drag `bankrobbery` into your resource folder and start it in `server.cfg`
- To add banks go into the `config.lua` file and edit. I  provide two (2) banks for you and that is the Fleeca bank on route 68 and the Fleeca bank in Legion Square

## Support
Currently I don't have anyway to contact me directly, but the best way to recive support is here on github, the fivem forums, or any FiveM discord that offers scripting support.

## Future Updates 
- Add Framework Support for (ESX, QBCore, and ND_Core)
  
*If you add these supports before me please create a pull request for the repo*
